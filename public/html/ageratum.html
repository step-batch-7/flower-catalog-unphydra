            Ageratum, (whiteweed in the USA), is a genus of 40[3] to 60
            tropical and warm temperate flowering annuals and perennials
            from the family Asteraceae, tribe Eupatorieae. Most species are
            native to Central America and Mexico but four are native to the
            United States.

            They form tussocks or small hills. They grow to a height of 30
            in. The opposite leaves are cordate or oval, hairy or
            tomentose. The margins are slightly toothed or serrate. The
            leaves form compact clusters.

            The fluffy flowers are lavender-blue, pink, lilac, or white;
            and spread in small compound umbels. They give small, dry
            fruits.
